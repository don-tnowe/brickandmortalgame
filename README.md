# brickandmortalgame

A Godot 3 game in C#. Crawl through dungeons as a monster merchant selling treasures from the depths at unacceptable prices.

- Fight treasure guardians to get sweet, sweet loot
- Sell your loot at your very own store
- Raise the prices until they get mad!!! But not too mad, they must be able to afford it.

Made for a university course project. Will probably develop it further, though.
